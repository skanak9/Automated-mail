ðŸ“§ Automated Email Sender Using Python
This project demonstrates how to automate the process of sending emails using Python. Leveraging the built-in smtplib and email libraries, the script allows users to send personalized messages programmatically through an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail). It supports secure login, customizable subject and body content, and dynamic recipient handling. Ideal for notification systems, report automation, and daily email tasks, this script simplifies routine communication through efficient scripting.
